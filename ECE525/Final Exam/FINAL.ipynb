    "D) Harmonic restraint and harmonic blocking are two methods primarily used to avoid erraneously tripping durring transformer energization (and subsequent inrush). Harmonic restraint was typically applied in electro-mechanical relays as a mode of restraining the operate coil and trip mechanism. Harmonic blocking is a method typically applied in microprocessor relays which monitors the level of second harmonic to make decisions on whether the transformer is currently being energized. These methods should be acting when the transformer is being energized and presents a significant load as itself. During these circumstances, the transformer differential protection will appear to have detected an internal fault. Although it is possible for an internal fault to actually be present, it is likely just the fact that most current is being consumed by the magnetization branch of the transformer to induce the flux appropriately.\n",

    "\n",
    "A)\n",
    "1. CT saturation can impact internal faults by \"limiting\" a fault current to a specific level so that in protection logic, the bus currents still sum to zero, even if they really don't. This is an extremely unlikely event due to the circumstances that would have to be aligned to support such operation.\n",
    "2. CT saturation can affect external faults by making them appear (to the relay) as if they are internal. Because the fault current on one or more CTs press the CT into saturation, and the secondary currents don't accurately reflect the primary currents, the relay will perceive the fault as internal since the bus currents will no longer sum to zero. External faults are more of a concern as this behavior will negatively impact protection coordination and potentially cause false trips and incur large expenses for utilities and their customers.\n",
    "3. A few options will help reduce saturations effects on security.\n",
    "    - Increasing CT ratings to reduce risk of saturation will certainly have a great benefit.\n",
    "    - Using coordinated and communications-assited protection may be of benefit. In substations, there are no doubt additional relays monitoring the lines fed by busses, the relays protecting these lines (if not using the same CTs as the bus protection relay) could provide confirmation that validates the current differential issue perceived by the bus protection relay. If the line relay's current doesn't match that of the bus protection relay, there is likely a case of saturation.\n",
    "    - Reducing CT burden can also significantly improve performance by reducing the likelyhood of CT saturation.\n",
    "    - High-speed fault identification and supervisory logic can also be used to determine a fault's presence as internal or external and provide supervisory control to block tripping when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) Although ring busses may not be quite as simple to apply differential protection, the method may still apply. Since the driving law (KCL) still applies to ring bus configurations, differential protection can still be used, it just may not be as easy to apply. However, in cases where differential protection cannot be applied, breaking bus protection into two or more zones may also be useful. In such cases, the ability to have a dynamically configurable protection relay (like the SEL-487B) is very useful. Such relays can make decisions on the fly to reconfigure zone protection based on breaker status, load status, or other factors. Such performance can improve overall reliablity and security of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Breaker failure is essentially just as the name implies. The breaker fails to either open or close on command. In many cases, this issue is presented as a breaker that fails to close, creating what is known as a \"phase-open\" case where one of three phases remains open and creates unbalance. Such phenomena on a transmission system can cause extremely adverse conditions by weilding \"fault-like\" conditions at other protective devices, or conditions that cause a larger system-wide issue, potentially cascading to system instability. Using breaker monitor logic (monitoring the ANSI 52 contact status of the breaker) and sequence logic, relays should accurately be able to detect such failure and either trip as necessary or transfer the trip command (via communications channel) to another protective device whose action is better suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "D) In combination with differential logic monitoring the current flow through the transformers, contact and status monitoring devices could be implimented to identify the current tap states for the two transformers. Additionally, directional protection supervision could be utilized to aid in identifying where the current is circulating."
